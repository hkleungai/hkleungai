### My Experience in Web  

In general I gain a lot in various [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-yellow?logo=node.js" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-yellow?logo=node.js) project, and through the project experience I have been learning and relearning the essential basics, which includes but not limited to

* [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-yellow?logo=html5" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-yellow?logo=html5), with its semantic elements and general API
* [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-yellow?logo=javascript" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-yellow?logo=javascript), in the ECMA2016 standard
* [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/scss-yellow?logo=sass" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/scss-yellow?logo=sass), with its nested rules and mixins

On top of these, I help built frontend sites with the latest framework. Here just to list a few.
* [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react.js-red?logo=react" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/react.js-red?logo=react), with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react--redux-red?logo=redux" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/react--redux-red?logo=redux) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/antd-red?logo=ant-design" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/antd-red?logo=ant-design) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/styled--components-red?logo=styled-components" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled--components-red?logo=styled-components), in my last intern
* [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/vue.js-red?logo=vue.js" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/vue.js-red?logo=vue.js) with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/nuxt.js-red?logo=nuxt.js" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/nuxt.js-red?logo=nuxt.js) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/material--ui-red?logo=material-ui" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/material--ui-red?logo=material-ui), in my final year project

In case when using framwork seem like an overkill, I often will set up my own [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-green?logo=webpack" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-green?logo=webpack) bundler with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-green?logo=typescript" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-green?logo=typescript) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/eslint-green?logo=eslint" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/eslint-green?logo=eslint) support to facilitate project development.

It would be worth to mention that when dealing with frontend, I also get involved with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/socket.io-orange?logo=socket.io" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/socket.io-orange?logo=socket.io) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/json--web--tokens-orange?logo=json-web-tokens" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/json--web--tokens-orange?logo=json-web-tokens) in various project features, such as multi-client communication and authentication.

### My Experience in API and Database

In developing API, I have hands-on experience on traditional [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/php-purple?logo=php" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-purple?logo=php) and a more modern solution [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-purple?logo=express" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-purple?logo=express). In testing API, I prefer tools like [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/mocky-purple?logo=mocky-io" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/mocky-purple?logo=mocky-io) or [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/postman-purple?logo=postman" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/postman-purple?logo=postman) whenever I am able to set up my own locals.

I also have some experience in 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/oracle-light--green?logo=oracle" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/oracle-light--green?logo=oracle) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/mongoDB-light--green?logo=mongoDB" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/mongoDB-light--green?logo=mongoDB) development, with basic knowledge in schema model and field selection and population.

### My Favourite Programming Environment 

I love to solve problem with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-yellow?logo=javascript" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-yellow?logo=javascript) and also [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python-yellow?logo=python" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-yellow?logo=python), in particular I am still fascinated by the beauty with their functional programming aspect. That being said, I am still a fan on conventional object-oriented paradigm in languages like [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-yellow?logo=c%2B%2B" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-yellow?logo=c%2B%2B), or [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/java-yellow?logo=java" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-yellow?logo=java). 

For scripting langages, I like to have [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python-yellow?logo=python" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-yellow?logo=python) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/shell--script-yellow?logo=shell" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell--script-yellow?logo=shell) by my side. And the more I work with Linux / MacOS, the more I find how handy command-line interface (aka terminal) is. Although I could use [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/vim-pink?logo=vim" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/vim-pink?logo=vim) or [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/nano-pink?logo=nano" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/nano-pink?logo=nano) in CLI, I more often stick to the friendly [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-pink?logo=visual-studio-code" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-pink?logo=visual-studio-code) for editing purpose.
